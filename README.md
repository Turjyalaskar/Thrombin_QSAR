## Introduction

Thrombin is a pivotal enzyme in the blood coagulation cascade, playing a crucial role in forming blood clots. Dysregulation of thrombin activity can lead to thrombotic disorders such as strokes, heart attacks, and deep vein thrombosis. This report explores thrombin inhibitors' structure-activity relationship (SAR), aiming to identify key compounds that can effectively modulate thrombin activity.
